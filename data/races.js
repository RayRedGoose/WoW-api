  description: "Recent discoveries have shown that humans are descended from the barbaric vrykul, half-giant warriors who live in Northrend. Early humans were primarily a scattered and tribal people for several millennia, until the rising strength of the troll empire forced their strategic unification. Thus the nation of Arathor was formed, along with its capital, the city-state of Strom.",
  history: "After centuries of peace, the increasingly independent city-states of Arathor split into kingdoms: Gilneas to the west, Alterac, Dalaran, and Lordaeron to the northwest, Kul Tiras to the southwest, and Stormwind to the far south. Strom itself was renamed Stromgarde and remained a powerful kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut disaster struck when the orcish Horde appeared on Azeroth and reduced Stormwind to ruins. The city’s survivors, including the young prince, Varian Wrynn, fled to Lordaeron, where the leaders of the seven kingdoms resolved to unify once again in the Alliance of Lordaeron. Together, they succeeded in defeating the Horde. But peace for the Alliance would only prove to be temporary.\r\n\r\nAs upkeep costs rose, Gilneas and Stromgarde withdrew their kingdoms from the Alliance. Then came a plague that killed thousands of humans and converted them into undead servants of the Lich King. Lordaeron’s prince, Arthas Menethil, was manipulated by the Lich King, leading Arthas to kill his own father and journey to Northrend, where he merged with his master and became the next Lich King. For the next five years, Arthas remained in Northrend, plotting and building up his armies.\r\n\r\nBut before Arthas could unleash his gathered power, humans and other other races banded together, securing a costly victory. Members of the Horde and the Alliance launched separate campaigns in Northrend, and their efforts resulted in the Lich King’s defeat.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Stormwind has become the strongest bastion of humanity and the most powerful force in the now multi-racial Alliance. Now, the people of Stormwind hold fast to the principles of honor and justice as they defend their settlements and their allies.",

  description: "The bold and courageous dwarves are an ancient race descended from the earthen—beings of living stone created by the titans when the world was young. Due to a strange malady known as the Curse of Flesh, the dwarves’ earthen progenitors underwent a transformation that turned their rocky hides into soft skin. Ultimately, these creatures of flesh and blood dubbed themselves dwarves and carved out the mighty city of Ironforge in the snowy peaks of Khaz Modan.",
  history: "For many years, three dwarven clans—the Bronzebeards, the Wildhammers, and the Dark Irons—lived united in Ironforge under the wise rule of High King Modimus Anvilmar. When Modimus passed away, tensions boiled over among the clans, and war erupted for control of the city. Thus began the War of the Three Hammers, a savage conflict that raged for many years, during which time the Bronzebeard clan won sole ownership of Ironforge, severing relations among the other clans and expelling its rivals.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, a twist of fate has drawn the rival clans back to Ironforge after they’ve spent centuries apart….\r\n\r\nWhen freak natural disasters rocked Azeroth just prior to the Cataclysm, dwarven lands were not spared from calamity. A series of quakes tore through areas surrounding Ironforge, reducing settlements to rubble and taking the lives of many innocent dwarves. To glean answers as to the troubling state of the world, King Magni underwent a mystic ritual to commune with the earth. The ceremony, however, had an unexpected effect: Magni was transformed into diamond and became fused to the depths of Ironforge itself.\r\n\r\nIn the power vacuum that followed, his estranged daughter, Moira, who had married into the despised Dark Iron clan, briefly claimed Ironforge’s throne and effectively locked down the city. If not for the intervention of King Varian Wrynn of Stormwind and his son, Prince Anduin, her actions might have sparked another civil war. With Varian’s guidance, control of Ironforge has since been divided equally among the Bronzebeard, Wildhammer, and Dark Iron clans through the Council of Three Hammers. As the clans put aside their old quarrels and began working together, the council’s ability to govern as one shows promise.",

  history: "The Legion’s emergence had forever changed night elven society. Under the leadership of Tyrande Whisperwind and Malfurion Stormrage, they cultivated a peaceful civilization, and shunned the use of arcane magic, which had attracted the Legion to Azeroth.\r\n\r\nBut the night elves’ tranquility was shattered anew when the Legion and its terrifying undead Scourge launched a new invasion of Azeroth in the modern times--a conflict known as the Third War. The Night Elves fought alongside the Horde and Alliance to defeat the Legion, but their victory was only made possible through an explosion that damaged the blessed World Tree, which had long granted the night elves immortality and protection from aging and disease.\r\n\r\nAgainst Malfurion’s warnings, renegade druids created a new World Tree in hopes of restoring the night elves’ immortality. But this new World Tree eventually became tainted by a dark malady called the Emerald Nightmare, which the night elves were able to combat with Malfurion’s aid.\r\n\r\nAlthough the night elves still struggle to cope with the loss of immortality, the fate of Azeroth rests on their resilience and willingness to aid other races; qualities which the Burning Legion will surely test again.",

Brilliant inventors with an irrepressibly cheerful disposition, this race has suffered treachery, displacement, and near-genocide. It is their remarkable optimism in the face of such calamity that symbolizes the truly unshakable spirit of the gnomes.​",
  history: "The diminutive gnomes—renowned mechanics, engineers, technicians and tool-makers—have made their mark on Azeroth through the application of a collective intelligence and ambition overshadowing that of their larger peers.\r\n\r\nAlthough little is known concerning gnomish history previous to the Second War, much of gnomish philosophy and recorded knowledge is focused on forward-thinking, inventive concepts. However, recent developments have uncovered evidence that they originated from titan creations; mechanical helpers that were afflicted with the Curse of Flesh, becoming the gnomes of today.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until their discovery by the dwarves centuries later that gnomes were recognized as a viable and important race. The dwarves were impressed with the ingenuity and quickness of their smaller “kin” (for they had also been titan-forged and similarly cursed), and they assisted the gnomes in constructing a capital city, Gnomeregan, in the foothills of Dun Morogh near the dwarves’ own capital of Ironforge. From their wondrous techno-city, gnomes provided invaluable support in weaponry, vehicles, and energetic troops to the Alliance of dwarves, humans, and high elves.\r\n\r\nBut when the Burning Legion invaded during the Third War, the gnomes strangely refused to send aid to their allies. It wasn’t until the war had ended that the Alliance learned the reason for the gnomes’ withdrawal; an ancient menace had risen from the bowels of Azeroth to strike at Gnomeregan. Knowing that their allies’ priority was defeating the Burning Legion, the gnomes decided to make their stand alone. Though they fought valiantly to save their beloved city, Gnomeregan was lost.\r\n\r\nMost of the gnome race was wiped out during the fall of Gnomeregan; some say that as much as 80 percent of Azeroth’s gnomes died during those horrible days. The few survivors fled and established New Tinkertown, where they quietly went about rebuilding their forces, healing their wounds, and preparing to retake Gnomeregan.",

  description: "Long before the fallen titan Sargeras unleashed the Legion on Azeroth, he conquered the world of Argus and its inhabitants, the eredar. Believing that this gifted race would be crucial in his quest to undo all of creation, Sargeras contacted the eredar’s leaders – Kil’jaeden, Archimonde, and Velen, offering them knowledge and power in exchange for their loyalty.",
  history: "Only Velen abstained, for he had seen a vision. In it, his people were transformed into demons; members of Sargeras’ Burning Legion, a growing army of unspeakable evil. With the aid of the benevolent naaru, Velen gathered like-minded eredar and escaped Argus. These renegades would call themselves the draenei, or “exiled ones.”\r\n\r\nKil’jaeden, infuriated by the draenei’s flight from Argus and their refusal of Sargeras’ offer, led the Legion’s armies in pursuit of his former people throughout the cosmos. But the draenei eluded their hunters, discovering sanctuary on a remote world that they would name Draenor. There, the draenei developed an extraordinary society and coexisted peacefully with the shamanistic orcs native to the planet Draenor.\r\n\r\nKil’jaeden eventually found Draenor and corrupted the noble orcs into a single, bloodthirsty force: the Horde. Blinded by rage, the Horde slaughtered most of the draenei race and forced any survivors into hiding. After being exposed to fel energies wielded by orc warlocks, many draenei were mutated into physically deteriorated forms known as the Krokul, or “Broken,”. Years later, the shaman Ner’zhul opened magical portals throughout Draenor, and the resulting energies shattered the dying world.\r\n\r\nWhat remained of Draenor—henceforth known as Outland—devolved into a battleground among the Burning Legion and other factions vying for control of the ruined landscape. To escape the chaos, Velen and a number of his followers commandeered a dimensional fortressnamed the Exodar. In search of new allies, the draenei left Outland.\r\n\r\nHowever, the blood elves had sabotaged the Exodar’s engines, and the draenei ultimately crash-landed on the world of Azeroth, where they pledged their loyalty to the Alliance. Together with their new allies, Velen and his refugees returned to Outland and defeated their demonic rivals. But Velen had another vision: a coming war between the forces of light and darkness.

Human scholars intensely debated the origins of the curse, until it was revealed that the original worgen were not—as previously believed—nightmares from another dimension, but cursed night elf druids.",
  history: "Long ago, amid a brutal war between the night elves and the demonic satyrs in Kalimdor, a group of druids practiced the ability to transform into a powerful yet unwieldy form that embodied the fury of the wolf Ancient, Goldrinn. Taught by Ralaar Fangfire, these Druids of the Pack sought to use the Scythe of Elune, a mystical artifact, to temper the uncontrollable rage inherent in their chosen form.\r\n\r\nRather than abate the druids’ fury, however, the Scythe transformed Ralaar and his followers into worgen: bestial humanoids enslaved by their own primal instincts.\r\n\r\nRalaar’s druids tore through friend and foe alike. Night elves wounded by the beasts contracted a virulent curse that turned them into worgen as well. Desperate to staunch the affliction’s spread, Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage banished the worgen to a part of the Emerald Dream—Azeroth’s spirit world—where they would be in peaceful slumber for all eternity.\r\n\r\nThe worgen threat was contained for millennia, until Archmage Arugal pulled the wolf-beasts from the Dream. Summoned by order of King Genn Greymane, the worgen battled Scourge forces encroaching on the kingdom of Gilneas. Yet the feral creatures soon spread their curse throughout the human population, infecting Gilnean soldiers stationed beyond the Greymane Wall.\r\n\r\nThe night elves, feeling responsible for the creation of the curse and the destruction it caused, agreed to help the Gilneans. With the Scythe of Elune, the night elves could not permanently cure the affliction, but managed to teach the Gilneans how to control their curse; shapeshifting at will from human to worgen, and back again. Now, these self-disciplined worgen have rejoined the Alliance as powerful allies, prepared to fight to keep their humanity and their place in society.",

The noble history of the pandaren people stretches back thousands of years, well before the empires of man and before even the sundering of the world.",
  history: "Denizens of a wondrous and fertile land, the pandaren once labored under the oppressive thumb of a monstrous race of ancient warlords known as the mogu. Through tenacity, diplomacy, and a unique form of unarmed combat, the pandaren staged a successful revolution that deposed the mogu and established a pandaren empire that would prosper for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nHonorable and filled with a love of good company, good food--and every now and then, a good friendly brawl--the pandaren have been content to live in seclusion, allowing their culture to flourish and thrive away from the influence of the outside world. However, every now and then, a pandaren is born with a thirst for adventure that rivals his or her thirst for a strong drink, and he or she strikes out to explore beyond Pandaria’s shores.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous such wanderers was the brewmaster Chen Stormstout, who set out looking for exotic ingredients for his special ale and wound up an integral part of the founding of the Horde.\r\n\r\nDuring the bleak days that preceded the sundering of the world, when demons flooded onto Azeroth and threw the entirety of the mortal realm into jeopardy, the last Emperor of the pandaren discovered a way to protect his land from the devastation. His deal with fate shrouded his land within an impenetrable mist for ten thousand years, but the nature of his transaction has left Pandaria haunted ever since. Now, while some pandaren align themselves with the Horde and others with the Alliance, they all venture out to heal the world beyond their homeland.",

They abandoned their peaceful culture when Kil’jaeden, a demon lord of the Burning Legion, corrupted the orcs and used them in his vengeful plot against the draenei, who were exiles from Kil’jaeden’s homeworld.",
  history: "Kil’jaeden’s plan worked. The orcs drank the blood of Mannoroth—a prominent Burning Legion general—infusing them with power and enslaving them to the Legion. Exposure to fel energies turned their naturally brown skin into a sickly green. Under the demon’s influence, the orcs killed off most of the draenei population, but Kil’jaeden would not stop there.\r\n\r\nWith the orcs at their disposal, the Burning Legion planned to invade Azeroth once again. To this end, the corrupted human archmage Medivh conspired with the orc warlock Gul’dan to build the Dark Portal, a massive structure that would allow the orcs passage to Azeroth.\r\n\r\nArriving in Azeroth, the seemingly unstoppable orc armies, known as the Horde, crushed the human kingdom of Stormwind. Eventually, however, the humans made a last stand and were able to defeat the Horde and enslave most of the survivors. But a young slave named Thrall, together with Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer, fought to free the captive orcs. Orgrim died in battle, and the title of warchief, as well as Orgrim’s weapon, the Doomhammer, was passed onto Thrall. Thrall led his people to Kalimdor, where his friend and mentor, Grommash Hellscream, gave his life to defeat Mannoroth and forever free the orcs from the Legion’s control.\r\n\r\nYears later, Thrall returned to Draenor, now known as Outland, to once again stop the Legion. There, he convinced Garrosh, son of Grommash Hellscream, to join the Horde. Thrall believed that Garrosh would be a clear choice for his successor, but the impulsive young Hellscream’s uncontrolled aggression led him to commit heinous acts against the Horde itself. Thrall saw no choice but to overthrow Garrosh and name Vol’jin—troll chieftain of the Darkspear tribe—the new warchief of the Horde. With the memory of Garrosh’s betrayal clear in the minds of the other Horde races, Thrall and the orcs must once again prove they have overcome their old destructive tendencies.",

  history: "When the Lich King’s grasp on his vast armies faltered after the Third War, a contingent of undead broke free of their master’s iron will. This freedom seemed like a blessing, but the former humans were soon tormented by memories of the horrors they had committed as mindless Scourge. Those who did not descend into madness faced a chilling realization: the entirety of Azeroth sought their destruction.\r\n\r\nIn their darkest hour, the renegade undead were rallied by Sylvanas Windrunner, former Ranger-General of Quel’thalas, who had also regained her freedom from the Lich King. Under their new queen’s guidance, the independent undead—known as Forsaken—established the Undercity beneath the ruins of Lordaeron.\r\n\r\nTo further her own goals and protect her budding nation, Sylvanas set out to forge alliances. Chief among these were the tauren of Thunder Bluff, who saw the potential for redemption in the Forsaken. Thus, the tauren convinced then-Warchief Thrall to forge an alliance of convenience between the Forsaken and the Horde. The Forsaken assisted the Horde with a massive offensive against the Lich King and exacted vengeance upon their hated enemy.\r\n\r\nThe victory came at great cost; Grand Apothecary Putress betrayed the Forsaken, unleashing a new plague that decimated friend and foe alike, while the dreadlord Varimathras seized the Undercity in a coup that nearly killed Sylvanas. The usurpers were eventually slain and the Forsaken capital was restored, but the debacle created suspicion among the Horde regarding Sylvanas’ ability to lead and ensure the loyalty of the Forsaken.\r\n\r\nYet the Forsaken’s allegiance was proven anew when Sylvanas aided the Horde in freeing Orgrimmar from the control of Warchief Garrosh Hellscream, who sought to enslave the other races under orcish supremacy.

After befriending Warchief Thrall, Cairne and his tribe were able to fend off their enemies while they made a new home in Mulgore; the city of Thunder Bluff.

  history: "During the Third War, however, the high elves were nearly scoured from Azeroth. Led by the death knight Arthas, a Scourge army stormed into Quel’Thalas, slaughtering almost ninety percent of the kingdom’s population. Arthas then used the mystical Sunwell to resurrect the fallen necromancer Kel’Thuzad, irrevocably tainting the fount in the process.\r\n\r\nFearing that the befouled well would obliterate his dwindling race, Prince Kael’thas Sunstrider gathered a group of Quel’Thalas’s defenders and destroyed the fount to avert catastrophe. Although the high elves were spared from continued exposure to the Sunwell’s dark energies, in the fount’s absence they suffered terribly from withdrawal. As a result, Kael’thas desperately searched for a means to help his people—whom he had renamed the blood elves—and thus he set out for the shattered world of Outland. There he allied with the renegade demon Illidan Stormrage in the hopes of finding a cure for the blood elves’ crippling withdrawal.\r\n\r\nKael’thas had assured his people that one day he would return to Quel’Thalas and lead them to paradise, yet time revealed that his promises were nothing more than lies. On Outland, the prince became twisted due to his reliance on fel energy, the dark and corrupting essence wielded by the demonic Burning Legion itself. Unbeknownst to Illidan, Kael’thas also came under the sway of the Legion’s commander, Kil’jaeden.\r\n\r\nAt the bidding of his new master, the wayward prince eventually returned to Azeroth and seized the site of the Sunwell, hoping to use the fount as a means to usher Kil’jaeden into the world.

In the wake of Kil’jaeden’s defeat, the draenei prophet Velen purified the Sunwell with the Light-infused heart of a fallen naaru, transforming the fount into a source of both holy and arcane energies.\r\n\r\nInspired by the Sunwell’s rebirth, the blood elves have since entered into a shining new era in their ancient race’s history. Although some elves remain hesitant to abandon their dependence on arcane magic, others have embraced change for the betterment of Quel’Thalas.

  description: "Originally the slaves of jungle trolls on the Isle of Kezan, goblins were forced to mine kaja’mite ore out of the volcanic bowels of Mount Kajaro. The trolls used this potent mineral for their voodoo rituals, but it had an unexpected effect on the slaves who were in constant contact with it: kaja’mite generated new cunning and intelligence in the goblin race.",
  history: "Crafting powerful artifacts of engineering and alchemy in secret, the goblins soon overthrew their oppressors and claimed Kezan for their homeland. The mines that had once been the goblins’ prison,   and  slave camp became the city of Undermine. It was there that they built the foundations of an empire, and honed their inherent craftiness (some would call it duplicity) to a razor edge. The goblins’ inventions would help them rule the world—or at least own a profitable percentage of it.\r\n\r\nTo the goblins’ dismay, the effects of the kaja’mite began to wear off, and their intelligence waned. Even worse, the ore itself became more scarce. Supplies dwindled. Desperation ensued…\r\n\r\n The goblins’ once-brilliant inventions started to look haphazard and makeshift, and Kezan’s native swindlers realized that they would need to find other ways to supplement their avarice. The goblins’ remaining craftiness and greed soon lifted the race to preeminence as masters of mercantilism.  Great fortunes were amassed, and the Isle of Kezan became a hub for goblin trading ships. One ambitious trade prince agreed to lend his cartel’s services to the Horde in the Second War. Following the Horde’s defeat, the goblins realized that their profits could double if they weren’t stuck in a restrictive relationship. By the end of the Third War, goblins were providing services to both the Horde and the Alliance.\r\n\r\nRecently, the Bilgewater Cartel—the goblin faction based in Orgrimmar and Azshara—has found a new enemy in the Alliance. Unprofitable encounters with the secretive SI:7 branch of King Varian’s forces have driven Trade Prince Gallywix from comfortable neutrality. Reforging old pacts with their colleagues’ one-time allies, the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel have been welcomed into the Horde.",
